# School District Analysis
## Using data provided by the school district, we determined several performance values and provided a summary of the schools budget per each schools student pool. 
# Purpose:
## This analysis was first formed to create an overview of the district's high schools and their performance throughout reading and math scores. In addition, we were provided the type of school and their budget. With this information we were able to formulate a summary for the district's administrators. However, the data was later updated to retract data that was identified as no longer valid. This report will first show a comparison between these two reports to prove the difference between the two analysis, and highlight how we were able to continue the project. Lastly, we'll provide a summary of the analysis.
