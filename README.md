# School District Analysis
## Using data provided by the school district, we determined several performance values and provided a summary of the schools budget per each schools student pool. 
# Purpose:
## This analysis was first formed to create an overview of the district's high schools and their performance throughout reading and math scores. In addition, we were provided the type of school and their budget. With this information we were able to formulate a summary for the district's administrators. However, the data was later updated to retract data that was identified as no longer valid. This report will first show a comparison between these two reports to prove the difference between the two analysis, and highlight how we were able to continue the project. Lastly, we'll provide a summary of the analysis.

# Results based on retraction:
## This report entails the overview of how the school performed after retracting the ninth grade math and reading scores. The data compares each high school by performance in their overall average score in each subject, thier passing average based on their school size, and thier budgets. The budgets were broken down by allocating a dollar amount per the student body size. These set of number were then used to place each school into a budget pool.

# Results Based w/out retracted data:
## The report above was added to show how negligible the difference between our first analysis and our final report were for Thomas High Schools scores. This was included in order to provide evidence that even with the change, our data remained valid and caplable of providing the same results.
