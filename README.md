# School District Analysis
## Using data provided by the school district, we determined several performance values and provided a summary of the schools budget per each schools student pool. 
## Purpose:
### This analysis was first formed to create an overview of the district's high schools and their performance throughout reading and math scores. In addition, we were provided the type of school and their budget. With this information we were able to formulate a summary for the district's administrators. However, the data was later updated to retract data that was identified as no longer valid. This report will first show a comparison between these two reports to prove the difference between the two analysis, and highlight how we were able to continue the project. Lastly, we'll provide a summary of the analysis.

# Results:

## Results with retracted data:
### The report above entails how the school performed after retracting the ninth grade math and reading scores. As requested by the schoold district, it was found that the data recorded for the grade level was not valid. The report compares each high school by performance in the subject of math and reading scores, the average passing grades of those scores per grade level, the passing average per school size, and thier budgets. The budgets were broken down by allocating a dollar amount per the student body size. These number sets were then used to place each school into a budget pool.

## Results prior to retracting the data:
### The report above was added to show how negligible the difference between our first analysis and the final report. You'll see that Thomas High School's average scores did change by a fraction of a point. It was important for the validity of our final report that the data wasn't altered significantly. Instead, we saw no change in regards to the pattern that emerged from both reports.

## Top scoring Schools and bottom scoring schools:
### Above are the results showing how the Top five schools performed compared to the bottom five. Here we find that our top five schools are all charter schools and the bottom five are district schools. In addition, the top five schools also have a smaller class size in proportion to the other schools. This may provide an understanding for why the top schools per form better. More data is needed to evaluate how class sizes compare between each school, but based on these report we could induce that class size in district schools may play a role in the performance of the school. Perhaps a teacher per class size analysis may be required to further evaluate this hypothesis.

# Summary:
### In Conclusion, we were able to identify that some bias may exist towards charter schools. This is not conclusive but there budgets compared to schools with larger student bodies may hinder the opportunities of those in district schools as a result of larger class sizes to teacher ratios. This again, requires further data and analysis. We hope that we can at least show how charter schools outperform with much smaller student sizes.
