# The school district summary will be a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

## Total number of students
## Total number of schools
## Total budget
## Average math score
## Average reading score
## Percentage of students who passed math
## Percentage of students who passed reading
## Overall passing percentage
---
# Oragnizing Data
---
## we have two data frames

## school_data_df and it has five column headers
### School ID
### school_name
### type (Charter or District) 
### size (number of students)
### budget (fiscal year budget)

## student_data_df has seven columns
### Student ID
### student_name
### gender
### grade (grade level; freshman, junior, etc...)
### school_name
### reading_score
### math_score
---
# Plan:
## We'll be merging the the two dataframes using the merge() method.
# Note: upon merging there are 39170 rows and 11 columns
---
# To get the percentage of students who passed math and reading, we will write code to:

## Determine the passing grade.
## Get the number of students who passed math and reading in separate DataFrames.
## Calculate the number of students who passed math and reading.
## Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading.
---
# To get the overall passing percentage, we will write code to:

## Get the number of students who passed both math and reading in a DataFrame.
## Calculate the number of students who passed both math and reading.
## Calculate the percentage of students who passed both math and reading.
---
#Now that we have performed all the calculations needed for the district summary, 
#let's add the following values and columns to a new DataFrame named "district_summary_df"

## Total number of schools in the column "Total Schools"
## Total number of students in the column "Total Students"
## Total budget in the column "Total Budget"
## Average reading score in the column "Average Reading Score"
## Average math score in the column "Average Math Score"
## Percentage of students passing reading in the column "% Passing Reading"
## Percentage of students passing math in the column "% Passing Math"
## Overall passing percentage in the column "% Overall Passing"

Deliverable 3: A Written Report for the School District Analysis (25 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that summarizes your updated analysis and compares it with the results 
from the module.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to 
the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth 
grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
